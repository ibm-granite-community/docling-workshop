# Introduction

Welcome to our workshop!

<!-- In this workshop we'll be using the open-sourced [IBM Granite
AI foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) for a number of use cases that
demonstrates the value of [generative AI](https://developer.ibm.com/generative-ai-for-developers).

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Summarize a text document using [text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-summarization)
* Generate specific information from a large document using the [RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) technique
* Predict future trends using [time series forecasting](https://research.ibm.com/blog/AI-time-series-forecasting)
* Generate programming code ([Bash](https://opensource.com/resources/what-bash)) by [prompting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) a code model -->
