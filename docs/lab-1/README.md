# Document Conversion with Docling

The primary purpose of Docling is Document conversion. Docling enables us to convert documents various format into formats that are more useful in AI applications, while preserving document structure.

This lab walks through the different document conversion options Docling offers, as well as some enrichment features. We will also explore the converted documents to examine how Docling stores metadata to preserve document structure.

## Prerequisites

This lab is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Please follow the instructions in [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md) to run the lab.
